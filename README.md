# Google Data Analytics Professional Case Study

For the completion of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certification, I selected to do my case study on the fictional Chicago, 'Cyclistic' bike-share company.

The goal of this case study is to perform detailed analysis of annual bike share data to understand patterns, trends, and relationships in the company. The business task of the company is to maximize the number of membership riders by converting the non-member riders into member riders. 

In this case study, I followed the 6 steps of any data analytics project given by Google. The steps are: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. I made use of data analytics tools such as Microsoft Excel, MySQL, R programming language, and also Tableau for creating the visual graphics I have embedded. 

I have shared my marketing strategy for this business task at the end after careful analysis of the recorded data.
